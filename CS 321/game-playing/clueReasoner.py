'''ClueReasoner.py - project skeleton for a propositional reasoner
for the game of Clue.  Unimplemented portions have the comment "TO
BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN EXERCISE".  The reasoner does not include
knowledge of how many cards each player holds.

            4 possible cases once you get to this point:

             A. Scarlet is suggesting and her refuter won't shower her the cardâ€”she 
                can conclude her refuter has at least one of three cards, therefore one 
                of the three is not in cf 

             B. Scarlett is witnessing, and has none of the cards in the suggestion. 
                She can conclude the same as in A
            
             C. Scarlett is witnessing, and has one of the cards in the suggestion 
                (but refute happened before her turn). She can conclude the same as in A, 
                except the refuter can have at most two of the cards.

             D. Scarlett is witnessing, and has two of the cards in the suggestion
                (but refute happened before her turn). She can deduce the exact card the 
                refuter has as well as conclude that none of the three cards in the suggestion
                are contained in the cf. 

            Unfortunately, we only have access to refuter and suggester, and I can't
            think of a practical way to implement without player access. :(
            
            Only works if refuter or suggester is Scarlett (since hers is the only hand we know).
